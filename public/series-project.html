<h1>Top Series I Like The Most</h1>
<h2>The series I can remember at this moment</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Arrow</h3>
<p>My actual first series. Really loved it. Probably one of the very few series I could still binge-watch from start to finish today if given the chance.</p>

<h3>The Flash</h3>
<p>Dropped this because of how the later seasons were badly done. Couldn't bring myself to finish it till now but still love it regardless. First few seasons were very good though.</p>

<h3>Umbrella Academy</h3>
<p>Got into this during lockdown and loved it then. Despite a few weird things along the line still love it now. Final season released just yesterday.</p>
